Created in Python 3.10.6
Dependencies can be found in requirements.txt, with the exception of PyICU, pycld2 and futures.

pip3 install scikit-learn
pip3 install theano
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install nltk

In python, run:
import nltk
nltk.download("punkt")
nltk.download("stopwords")
nltk.download("rslp")

If using Linux, run:

    pip3 install polyglot

If using Windowsm polyglot is not yet stable, and requires the following installation process:

    For the dependencies, search for the "PyICU", "pycld2" and "futures" wheels.
    (PyICU and pycld2 need to be of the correct version of python you are using, in my case, 310 for 3.10.6)

    PyICU‑2.9‑cp310‑cp310‑win_amd64.whl
    pycld2‑0.41‑cp310‑cp310‑win_amd64.whl
    futures-3.2.0+dummy-py3-none-any.whl

    Most wheels for manual download can be found here: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

    In the directory where the wheels are, run

    python -m pip install PyICU‑2.9‑cp310‑cp310‑win_amd64.whl
    python -m pip install pycld2‑0.41‑cp310‑cp310‑win_amd64.whl
    python -m pip install futures-3.2.0+dummy-py3-none-any.whl

    You may need to download and install the "morfessor" wheel "Morfessor-2.0.6-py3-none-any.whl" as well.

    Install polyglot from git:

    git clone https://github.com/aboSamoor/polyglot.git
    cd polyglot
    python setup.py install

    After checking if the import was successful with "from polyglot.text import Text" in python, the cloned repo can be deleted.

When using polyglot for a specific language other than english, you may need to download embeddings and parts-of-speech for that language.
For example, for working with text in portuguese (pt), you run in the comand prompt:

polyglot download embeddings2.pt
polyglot download pos2.pt
